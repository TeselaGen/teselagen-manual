####Welcome to Teselagen's Manual. 

We strive to provide a design-build-test-evolve platform for automated combinatorial DNA assembly; with sequence viewing and editing, forward design, and scarless assembly all at the least possible cost. Please use the menu on the left to learn more about our Platform.
