###### Multi-well plate: Error: can't find a well containing purely content_type with at least min_volume uL available in any of the plates.
This error arises when searching through all of the source multi-well plates for a well that contains at least min_volume uL of available pure content_type, and not being able to find such a well. This might happen, for example, if not enough of a particular PCR template is available to distribute to all of the PCR reactions that use it. One solution is to add more pure content_type to an another (empty) source plate well.

###### Multi-well plate: plate plate_ID well plate_well is too full to add an additional volume uL of liquid.
This error arises when attempting to add an additional volume uL of liquid to well plate_well in plate plate_ID when this additional volume would exceed the well's maximum capacity. Check the downstream automation parameters file to make sure that the maximum well capacity volume is what you intended, and that the multi-well plate files don't over allocate liquids to the well plate_well in plate plate_ID.
