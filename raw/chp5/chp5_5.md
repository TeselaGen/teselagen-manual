To make a part out of a sequence, you need to open a sequence, then select a portion of the sequence, and then clicking the create part button in the toolbar. After clicking on the "create part" button, you will see a window where you can edit the part's name, it's position in the source sequence, and which strand you want it on. You can also decide if you want the part to be mapped to the whole sequence or just a part of it.

After mapping a sequence (or part of a sequence) into a DNA part, you will be able to see it within your part library.
