The NextGen expression workstation control j5 output file is a CSV file that instructs the NextGen robotic platform to put together the desired PCR reaction mixtures from the specified source plates containing the PCR templates and DNA oligos, and to deposit them into the destination PCR plates. This file looks very similar to the PCR Reactions subsection of the distribute PCR reactions file, except the plate wells are referenced by index (e.g. 1 to 96) instead of by the more familiar nomenclature (e.g. "A01" to "H12"). The well indexes increase sequentially down a given column and in leap across columns. The first line in the file is a header line that does not contain PCR reaction information, but rather just serves to name the columns below.

control:TEMPLATE_VOLUME column fields:
Provides additional control over the NextGen robot. "Normal" is an acceptable value here.

control:PRIMER1_VOLUME column fields:
Provides additional control over the NextGen robot. "Normal" is an acceptable value here.

control:PRIMER2_VOLUME column fields:
Provides additional control over the NextGen robot. "Normal" is an acceptable value here.

TEMPLATE_WELL column fields:
The index of the well (e.g. "1") containing the PCR template for this row's PCR reaction.

PRIMER1_WELL column fields:
The index of the well (e.g. "1") containing the forward primer for this row's PCR reaction.

PRIMER2_WELL column fields:
The index of the well (e.g. "1") containing the reverse primer for this row's PCR reaction.

OUTPUT_WELL column fields:
The index of the well (e.g. "1") serving as the destination for this row's PCR reaction.

Other column fields are identical to those described in the distribute PCR reactions file documentation section.
