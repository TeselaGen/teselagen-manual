## Changing column SBOL Visual icons

After adding columns to the collection, it is possible to select the SBOL Visual Icons for the columns.

###### INITIAL SBOL VISUAL ICON SELECTION:

Each column within the collection may be optionally associated with a SBOL Visual icon in the header row immediately above the collection. To initially select a SBOL Visual icon for a column, click on the corresponding column and then click on the SBOL icon that you would like to associate with the column. The SBOL icons are displayed just above the design canvas. When the cursor hovers over one of the SBOL Visual icons, the description (e.g. "Origin of Replication") of the icon pops up (a handy reference in case some of the symbols are unfamiliar to you).

###### CHANGING A SBOL VISUAL ICON:

After a SBOL Visual icon has been associated with a column, it is possible to easily change the SBOL Visual icon part by clicking on the corresponding column and then clicking on the new icon that you would like to associate with the column.

After optionally associating SBOL Visual icons with the columns, the next steps are to change the assembly orientations of the columns, name the columns, and/or set the columns' j5 assembly directives.
