## Changing column assembly orientations

After adding columns to the collection, it is possible to change the assembly orientations of the columns, which affect how the parts in each column will be incorporated into the resulting DNA constructs (e.g. in the forward direction (top-strand) or reverse direction (bottom-strand)).
 
The assembly orientation is indicated by a left (reverse) or right (forward) arrow button to the right of the SBOL icon. The assembly orientation can be flipped by clicking on this arrow button in the header row. Doing so will flip the assembly orientation of the column. When changing a column's orientation, the associated SBOL Visual icon (if any) will also be rotated 180 degrees (although for symmetric icons, like the "Operator Site", there will be no discernible difference) to reflect the change.

After changing the assembly orientations of the columns, the next steps are to name the columns, and/or set the columns' j5 assembly directives.
