## Adding and removing columns

After starting a DeviceEditor session, it is possible to add columns to, or remove columns from, the collection in the design canvas.

The relative (combinatorial) arrangement of the parts in the collection defines the DNA sequence(s) to be constructed. The collection contains one or more columns, where the total number of columns is equal to the total number of parts desired to be assembled together into the resulting construct. Parts placed into adjacent columns will be adjacent in the resulting assembled DNA sequence(s) (with the last column cyclically followed by the first column for circular DNA designs such as plasmids). Parts in the same column are considered combinatorial variants of/alternatives for each other. That is to say, each individual construct in the resulting combinatorial library contains exactly one of the parts in each column.

###### ADDING COLUMNS:

If you would like to append a column to the collection, simply select a column and then, under "Insert" in the top menu bar, select either "Column left" or "Column right", depending if you would like to insert a column to the left or right of the selected column (correspondingly). 

###### REMOVING COLUMNS:

If you would like to remove a column within the design canvas, select the corresponding column and then, under "Edit" in the top menu, select "Remove Column". 

Note that, under the "Edit" top menu, you an "Undo" or "Redo" the actions of adding or removing a column.
After adding columns to the collection, the next steps are to select SBOL Visual icons for the columns, change the assembly orientations of the columns, name the columns, and/or set the columns' j5 assembly directives.
