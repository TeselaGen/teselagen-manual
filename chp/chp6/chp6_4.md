## Changing column names

After adding columns to the collection, it is possible to name the columns.

Within the design canvas portion of the DeviceEditor display, the name of each of the columns is displayed in the header row above the collection and just below the corresponding SBOL icon.

Within the "Collection Info" tab in the panel on the right side of the DeviceEditor display, it is possible to change the names of the columns. In the collection table, double-click on desired column entry and edit the column name as you see fit. After you have edited the name, click on the "Update" button. Generally, column names are useful for combinatorial designs, where the column can be named so as to reflect the class of part variants it contains (e.g. "terminator" might be a good name for a column that contains a variety of terminator sequences). The assembly orientation of each column is presented in the second column (whose header reads "Direction") of the table and can also be edited by double-clicking on the desired column entry. The number of items within each column is presented in the third column (whose header reads "Items in Column") of the table. The Forced Assembly Strategy of each column is presented in the fourth column (whose header reads "FAS") of the table.

The last four table columns (whose headers read "DSF", "FRO", "5'X" and "3'X", which might only be visible when scrolling to the right) will be discussed in the next section: controlling collection bin assembly directives for j5.
