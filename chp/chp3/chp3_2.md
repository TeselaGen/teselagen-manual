## Bioinformatics and BioCAD preliminaries

Given the scope of TeselaGen's BETA release functionality, there are often several upstream and downstream tasks to consider.

#### Upstream preparation:

TeselaGen BETA sits immediately downstream of identifying the parts you would like to include in your design. As discussed in the "Introduction to Bio CAD/CAM" section of this manual, there are a variety of bioCAD tools that may be able assist you in the component selection process. Many of these tools are already able to integrate with TeselaGen via Genbank or SBOL files, and more direct links will be available soon.

#### Downstream considerations:

TeselaGen BETA sits immediately upstream of physically assembling DNA into an assembled plasmid or linear fragment. As discussed in the "Bioinformatics/BioCAD prerequisites to SLIC/Gibson/CPEC and Golden Gate DNA assembly" sub-section of this manual, there are several aspects of a DNA design that can adversely affect downstream physical DNA assembly. Reviewing the particular situations that can be problematic for DNA construction, and using the appropriate tools to identify and resolve them can proactively guard against wasted effort.
