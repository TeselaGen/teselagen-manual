## Distribute PCR reactions file

The distribute PCR reactions j5 output file is a CSV file that contains information resulting from designing thermocycler block annealing temperature gradients for the set of PCR reactions contained within a j5 assembly file, and optimally arranging the PCR reactions on the block with respect to the designed gradient. The first line in the file is a header line that just serves to identify the downstream automation task selected (e.g. "Distribute PCR Reactions"), as well as the version of j5 used to generate the assembly (e.g. "v0.1alpha") and the date that the assembly was designed (e.g. "3/23/2011").

Here is an example first line header:

If any problems are encountered when inputting the downstream automation parameters file, or if more than six source plates are utilized (no PR-PR configuration files output), j5 will place the resulting warning messages immediately following the first line header.
