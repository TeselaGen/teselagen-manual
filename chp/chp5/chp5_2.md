## Creating a sequence

As soon as you log in, you will see your dashboard with several icons that allow you to easily create a project or a sequence. If you click on "Create Sequence", you will see a vector editor, with a vector map to the left and a vector sequence editor to the right. Simply start typing nucleotide letters in the sequence editor to start composing your sequence. As soon as you are finished, go to the top menu, and under "File", click on "Save as" to  give your sequence a name.

Alternatively, you can create a new sequence by clicking on the "+" button to the right of the "My sequences" link under the Explorer window (which you will find to the left of your window).
