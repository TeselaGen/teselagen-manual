## Editing a part's name or definition

After mapping a sequence to a part, it is possible to change the part's name or how it is defined.

###### CHANGING A PART'S NAME:

With a part selected (active) in the design canvas, it is possible to change the name of the selected part in the panel on the right side of the DeviceEditor display. Change the "Part Name" field to the name you would like to give to the part, and then hit "Enter" (or "Return") on your keyboard. 

NOTE: with a part selected (highlighted with a gray outline in the design canvas) it is possible to name the part even if the part has yet to be mapped to a sequence. Parts that have been named, but have yet to be mapped to a sequence, are colored with a red outline on the design canvas.

###### SELECTING A PART FROM THE LIBRARY:

With a part cell selected (active) in the design canvas, if no part has been already mapped to that cell, it is possible to click the "Select part library" red button in the panel on the right side of the DeviceEditor display. This will pop-up your "Part Library" dialog, which displays all the parts available for you within your Part Library. By clicking on one of the parts in your library, you will immediately assign that part to the selected part cell.


###### CHANGING A PART'S DEFINITION:

With a part selected (active) in the design canvas, clicking the "Change part definition" button in the panel on the right side of the DeviceEditor display will pop-up a "Specify Part Definition" dialog, which will allow you to change the definition of the part. In this dialog, you can change the name of the part (an alternate method to the one described immediately above), the portion of the part source sequence that corresponds to the part (e.g. toggle between "Whole Sequence" and "Specified Sequence"; and adjust the "StartBP" and "StopBP"), and whether or not the part is located on the complement strand of the part source.

Note: if you would like to change the sequence containing the part (the part source), you will need to re-map the desired sequence to the part.

###### CLEARING A PART:

With a part selected (active) in the design canvas, it is possible to clear it from the design canvas by clicking on the "Clear Part" blue button in the panel on the right side of the DeviceEditor display.
