## Mock Assembly output file

The Mock assembly j5 output file is a CSV file that contains all of the information resulting from the Mock assembly design process. The first line in the file is a header line that just serves to identify the assembly method selected (e.g. "Mock"), as well as the version of j5 used to generate the assembly (e.g. "v0.1alpha") and the date that the assembly was designed (e.g. "4/7/2010").

All subsections are identical to those described for the j5 SLIC/Gibson/CPEC/SLiCE assembly design output file. Note that the "Incompatibilities between Assembly Pieces", "Suggested Assembly Piece Contigs for Hierarchical Assembly", "Direct Synthesis", "Oligo Synthesis", "PCR Reactions" and "Assembly Pieces (SLIC/Gibson/CPEC/SLiCE)" subsections are not included in Mock assembly output files.
